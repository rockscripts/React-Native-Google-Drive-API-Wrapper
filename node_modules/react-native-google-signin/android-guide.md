## Android Guide

Please see the **FAQ** at bottom before opening new issues

### 1. Android SDK Requirements

You need the following packages

[![link config](https://github.com/apptailor/react-native-google-signin/raw/master/img/android-req.png)](#config)

### 2. Google project configuration

- Follow [this](./get-config-file.md) guide to get the configuration file.

- Place the generated configuration file (`google-services.json`) into `<YOUR_PROJECT_ROOT>/android/app`

### 3. Installation

Please note that this package requires android gradle plugin of version >= 3, which in turn requires at least gradle 4.1. Android studio should be able to do the upgrade for you.

- run `react-native link react-native-google-signin`

- In `android/settings.gradle` you should have

```gradle
...
include ':react-native-google-signin', ':app'
project(':react-native-google-signin').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/react-native-google-signin/android')
```

- Update `android/build.gradle` with

```gradle
...
dependencies {
    classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.1.2' // <--- update this
    classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:3.2.1' // <--- add this
}
...
allprojects {
    repositories {
        mavenLocal()
        maven {url "https://maven.google.com"} // <--- this should be added and should be above jcenter
        jcenter()
        google()
        maven {
            // All of React Native (JS, Obj-C sources, Android binaries) is installed from npm
            url "$rootDir/../node_modules/react-native/android"
        }
    }
}
```

- Update `android/app/build.gradle` with

```gradle
...
dependencies {
    implementation fileTree(dir: "libs", include: ["*.jar"])
    implementation "com.android.support:appcompat-v7:23.0.1"
    implementation "com.facebook.react:react-native:+"
    implementation(project(":react-native-google-signin")){
        exclude group: "com.google.android.gms" // very important
    }
    implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-auth:15.0.0' // should be at least 15.0.0 to work with most recent APIS
}

apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services' // <--- this should be the last line
```

- Choose Dependency versions (optional)

The library has several dependencies, as seens in [build.gradle](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-google-signin/blob/master/android/build.gradle). If needed, you may control their versions by the `ext` closure, as seen in [build.gradle](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-google-signin/blob/master/example/android/build.gradle) of the example app.

- Register Module (in MainApplication.java)

```java
import co.apptailor.googlesignin.RNGoogleSigninPackage;  // <--- import

public class MainApplication extends Application implements ReactApplication {

  ......

  @Override
    protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {
      return Arrays.<ReactPackage>asList(
          new MainReactPackage(),
          new RNGoogleSigninPackage() // <-- add this
      );
    }
  ......

}
```

### 4. Running on simulator

Make sure you have a simulator with Google Play installed.

Also to help with performances, install `HAXM` from the Android SDK Manager.

### Running on device

Nothing special here, as long as you run your app on a Google Android device (again with play store installed !)

## FAQ

#### A. My project includes other react-native plugins which have different google play services versions. What to do?

in `android/app/build.gradle` exclude google play services from the plugins you use. Like this:

```
compile(project(":PLUGIN_NAME")){
        exclude group: "com.google.android.gms"
}
```

Then include play services version you need (at least 9.0.0 for this plugin (!))

#### B. My project includes an older version of react-native-google-signin. How to upgrade?

first install the latest version
`npm install --save react-native-google-signin`

You need to follow this guide again to make sure everything fit together (gradle version, google-services gradle version, etc...). Check out the example project for reference.

clean everything to be sure

```
cd android
./gradlew clean
```

now `react-native run-android`

#### C. After upgrading and thoroughly following the guide the build fail with `Missing api_key/current_key object`. What to do?

open `android/app/google-services.json` and replace `"api_key":[]` with `"api_key":[{ "current_key": "" }]`

#### D. After the sign-in completes I get the following error `error code 12501`. What to do?

This is a permission error. Make sure the `certificate_hash` in `android/app/google-services.json` matches your certificate.

To get your sha1-hash

```
keytool -exportcert -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -list -v
```

Also make sure the application id matches the one you enter on the cloud console.

#### E. Getting `DEVELOPER_ERROR` error message on Android when trying to login.

This is configuration mismatch. Make sure that your `android/app/google-services.json` is correct.

If you're passing `webClientId` in configuration object to `GoogleSignin.configure()` make sure it's correct. You can get your `webClientId` from [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials). They're listed under "OAuth 2.0 client IDs".

If you're running your app in debug mode and not using `webClientId` or you're sure it's correct the problem might be signature (SHA-1 or SHA-256) mismatch. You need to add the following to `android/app/build.gradle`:

```diff
signingConfigs {
+    debug {
+        storeFile file(MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_FILE)
+        storePassword MYAPP_RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD
+        keyAlias MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS
+        keyPassword MYAPP_RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD
+    }
    release {
        ...
    }
 }
```

#### F. I did everything and I still have problems to compile my project.

Read this [medium article](https://medium.com/@suchydan/how-to-solve-google-play-services-version-collision-in-gradle-dependencies-ef086ae5c75f). Basically, if you have other play services libraries installed, you have to exclude some dependencies.
