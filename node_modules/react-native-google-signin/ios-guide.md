## iOS Guide

Includes Google Sign-In SDK v4.0.0

### 1. Installation

#### Automatic

- link the lib with `react-native link react-native-google-signin`
- install the Google Signin SDK with [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) (add `pod 'GoogleSignIn'` in your Podfile and run `pod install`).
  First time using cocoapods ? [check this out](./how-cocoapods.md)

#### Manual

if you did `react-native link react-native-google-signin` the first two steps are not necessary

- add `ios/RNGoogleSignin.xcodeproj` to your xcode project
- In your project build phase -> `Link binary with libraries` step, add `libRNGoogleSignin.a`, `AddressBook.framework`, `SafariServices.framework`, `SystemConfiguration.framework` and `libz.tbd`
- Drag and drop all files from `<root_project_dir>/node_modules/react-native-google-signin/ios/GoogleSdk` directory that end with `.framework` into the Frameworks group of application (Make sure `Copy items if needed` **IS** ticked)
- Go to `Build Settings` and add to `Framework Search Paths` path to GoogleSdk: by default `$(PROJECT_DIR)/../node_modules/react-native-google-signin/ios/GoogleSdk`

### 2. Google project configuration

- Follow [this](./get-config-file.md) guide to get the configuration file.

- Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file at the end of the process

### 3. XCode configuration

- Make sure all dependencies are correctly linked to your project:

[![link config](https://github.com/apptailor/react-native-google-signin/raw/master/img/link-config.png)](#config)

- Configure URL types in the `Info` panel
  - add a URL with scheme set to your `REVERSED_CLIENT_ID` (found inside the plist)
  - add a URL with scheme set to your `bundle id`

Add the end of this step, your Xcode config should look like this:

[![xcode config](https://github.com/apptailor/react-native-google-signin/raw/master/img/url-config.png)](#config)

### Modify your app to respond to the URL scheme

- Open `AppDelegate.m`
- Add an import: `#import "RNGoogleSignin.h"`
- Add a method to respond to the URL scheme:

```objc
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application openURL:(NSURL *)url
  sourceApplication:(NSString *)sourceApplication annotation:(id)annotation {

  return
          [RNGoogleSignin application:application
                                openURL:url
                      sourceApplication:sourceApplication
                             annotation:annotation
            ];
}
```

Because only one `openURL` method can be defined, if you have multiple listeners which should be defined (for instance if you have both Google and Facebook OAuth), you must combine them into a single function like so:

```objc
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application openURL:(NSURL *)url
  sourceApplication:(NSString *)sourceApplication annotation:(id)annotation {

  return [[FBSDKApplicationDelegate sharedInstance] application:application
                                                        openURL:url
                                              sourceApplication:sourceApplication
                                                     annotation:annotation
         ]
         || [RNGoogleSignin application:application
                                openURL:url
                      sourceApplication:sourceApplication
                             annotation:annotation
            ];
}
```
